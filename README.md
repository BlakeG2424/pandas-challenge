# Pandas-Challenge
In this assignment, I'll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. I will also include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. This analysis will be found at the bottom of this Readme.

# District Summary
In this portion, I will perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

It will include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# School Summary
In this portion, I will perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

The DataFrame will include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# I will also sort the schools by:
--Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
--Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
--Math Scores by Grade
--Reading Scores by Grade

# In this section i will create two tables (Scores by School Spending,Scores by School Size) 
Scores by School Spending:
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

The following metrics are in the table:

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

# Create a table showing 'Scores by School Type'

# Analysis
If you look closely at the "Scores by School Spending" table, we notice that the district schools are spending more money of their budget per student than the charter schools. While this is true, the charter schools still have a higher overall passing rate.

If you look closely at the "Scores by School Size" table, there is a notable difference of overall performance between school sizes. The more student populated schools tend to have lower performance than the less populated. 

In the last table, "Scores by School Type", it shows charter schools having an overwhelming better passing rate than district schools. Even though district schools have a higher spending budget per student, the smaller charter schools are performing better. This could be because of smaller classrooms and more hands on learning for the students.
